           <p class="measure f4 f5-ns lh-copy">
            I help CEOs, talent executives, and leadership teams use their most costly people conflicts and problems as drivers of constructive change, innovation and business results.
           </p>
           <p class="measure f4 f5-ns lh-copy">
            My 20+ years of experience as lawyer, mediator, strategist, negotiator and coach has taught me that the best and most sustainable solutions will come from you and your team. I am here to listen, strategize, advise, encourage, support, mentor and facilitate to hold you accountable for your brilliance and collective performance.
           </p>
           <p class="measure f4 f5-ns lh-copy">
             I focus on mission critical priorities, big challenges, and compelling opportunities. I nurture innovative leadership, teams and entire cultures that are in the midst of big change.  I partner with clients at all stages of enterprise development: start-up, scaling, pivoting, turn-around, transformation and exit.
           </p>
           <p class="measure f4 f5-ns lh-copy">
             I offer a complimentary/confidential 1 hour phone consultation to give you a taste of how I work and the results we generate together.

        <p class="measure f4 f5-ns lh-copy">
          You are in a top leadership position.  You are very busy, successful and high integrity.  You are facing a particularly difficult array of challenges associated with conflict, change or growth.  You get drawn into draining people conflicts and operational problems that distract you from your highest value work. Your leadership, teams and culture need support to break through to the next stage of success.
        </p>
        <p class="measure f4 f5-ns lh-copy">
          If this is some facsimile of you, and you are ready to quickly get clear, creative and into action - I can help.  Sometimes this is one phone consultation and sometimes it's a 3 year retained engagement.  All work is custom designed around your unique circumstances and mission critical priorities.

        “I have known James Kornbluh for many years as a very talented Facilitator and Coach.  His excellent listening skills serve him to accept many individual views of a situation and encourages finding common ground to work with and improve challenging relationships.  James is very intelligent, but what really differentiates him is his access to tuning into the unseen energies that are awaiting to assist all of us.  James is among the first people I have called for helping me see into my blind spots and I have always made better life and business decisions thanks to him. It is my honor and joy to recommend him highly.”

        “James Kornbluh is an incredible leadership resource.  At a time when I was a newly appointed Chief Executive I hired James to work with me to transform the culture and leadership of the governmental organization I lead.  Together we quickly developed a vision for the future and the structure for my leadership team that would drive performance and change throughout the culture.  James is a thoughtful listener, problem-solver and advisor, and was a tremendous help in support of my leadership and the team we needed to drive change in a large organization.”

        “James was a huge help for us at Ecovative when we needed to define and guide our culture for a fast growing team at a critical point in our development. He worked across departments and roles to synthesize the activities going on, and make specific recommendations around communication, organizational design, and overall cultural strategy. More personally, James was also an important resource to me.”

        “Working with James has been wonderful. He's quick to unearth hidden opportunities that you might not know you have. Once everything's out in the open he makes the plan of action to seize those opportunities clear as day. I can safely say that any team, or person for that matter, would greatly benefit from as little as 30 minutes with him.”
