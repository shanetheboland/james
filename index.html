          “I have known James Kornbluh for many years as a very talented Facilitator and Coach.  His excellent listening skills serve him to accept many individual views of a situation and encourages finding common ground to work with and improve challenging relationships.  James is very intelligent, but what really differentiates him is his access to tuning into the unseen energies that are awaiting to assist all of us.  James is among the first people I have called for helping me see into my blind spots and I have always made better life and business decisions thanks to him. It is my honor and joy to recommend him highly.”<br>

          “James Kornbluh is an incredible leadership resource.  At a time when I was a newly appointed Chief Executive I hired James to work with me to transform the culture and leadership of the governmental organization I lead.  Together we quickly developed a vision for the future and the structure for my leadership team that would drive performance and change throughout the culture.  James is a thoughtful listener, problem-solver and advisor, and was a tremendous help in support of my leadership and the team we needed to drive change in a large organization.”<br>

          “James Kornbluh is an excellent facilitator, trainer, coach, and conflict mediator. He has a deep understanding of how to cultivate leadership and help people move towards reaching their potential.  One thing that I really love about working with James is that he isn't wedded to one particular philosophy or approach. Because of that, he can listen deeply and make suggestions about what will really be transformative in the situation that you are in. He is thoughtful and has great intuition about what a group needs to accomplish the goals.  James is authentic and genuine and therefore builds trust quickly with the people he's working with.”<br>
