        <p class="measure f4 f5-ns lh-copy">
          My clients are busy, successful and high integrity. Even the best of them get mired in day to day operations, people conflicts and business problems. The most emotionally charged and threatening challenges to your leadership are typically the things that keep you up at night.
        </p>
        <p class="measure f4 f5-ns lh-copy">
          Our work together begins by transforming your most critical leadership challenges into a business opportunity. Sometimes this is one phone consultation and sometimes it's a 3 year retained engagement.
        </p>
        <p class="measure f4 f5-ns lh-copy">
          I offer a complimentary/confidential 1-hour phone consultation to executive leaders who self select their readiness and commitment to do something different and extraordinary for their leadership and their business.
        </p>
        <p class="measure f4 f5-ns lh-copy">
          At the end of this session you’ll feel clear on big challenges, big opportunities, and you’ll have a clear path to where you need to go.

        “I have known James Kornbluh for many years as a very talented Facilitator and Coach.  His excellent listening skills serve him to accept many individual views of a situation and encourages finding common ground to work with and improve challenging relationships.  James is very intelligent, but what really differentiates him is his access to tuning into the unseen energies that are awaiting to assist all of us.  James is among the first people I have called for helping me see into my blind spots and I have always made better life and business decisions thanks to him. It is my honor and joy to recommend him highly.”

        “James Kornbluh is an incredible leadership resource.  At a time when I was a newly appointed Chief Executive I hired James to work with me to transform the culture and leadership of the governmental organization I lead.  Together we quickly developed a vision for the future and the structure for my leadership team that would drive performance and change throughout the culture.  James is a thoughtful listener, problem-solver and advisor, and was a tremendous help in support of my leadership and the team we needed to drive change in a large organization.”

        “James was a huge help for us at Ecovative when we needed to define and guide our culture for a fast growing team at a critical point in our development. He worked across departments and roles to synthesize the activities going on, and make specific recommendations around communication, organizational design, and overall cultural strategy. More personally, James was also an important resource to me.”

        “Working with James has been wonderful. He's quick to unearth hidden opportunities that you might not know you have. Once everything's out in the open he makes the plan of action to seize those opportunities clear as day. I can safely say that any team, or person for that matter, would greatly benefit from as little as 30 minutes with him.”
